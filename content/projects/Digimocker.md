Digimocker is a microservice crafted in Node that aims to emulate the essential functionalities of the Digilocker API, which is restricted only for Digilocker partners to use.

This API allows users to register, sign up, store documents in a MongoDB database and fetch them. This can be integrated across any frontend/web app.
